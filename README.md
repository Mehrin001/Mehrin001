👋 Hi, I’m @Mehrin001

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, JavaScript, and turning raw data into meaningful insights

🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy, data visualization)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, dashboards, and beginner-friendly analytics case studies

📫 How to reach me: mehrin068@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy finding patterns in data the same way others enjoy solving puzzles
